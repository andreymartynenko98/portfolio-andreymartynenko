# Portfolio Website

A personal portfolio built with **HTML** and **CSS**. It showcases my work, including **AutoValue: Car Price Prediction** and **Deep Learning for Transportation Image Recognition**, while practicing clean markup, responsive layout, and accessible design.

## Contents

- `index.html` — site structure and content  
- `styles.css` — theme, layout, animations, and responsive rules  
- `assets/` — images and icons (e.g., `assets/avatar.jpg`)

## Focus Areas

- Writing clear, semantic, and accessible HTML  
- Building a consistent visual theme with CSS variables and Google Fonts  
- Responsive layout using Flexbox/Grid  
- Subtle animations and reduced-motion support  
- Simple, organized project structure

## Key Takeaways

This project strengthened how **HTML and CSS** work together to create a polished, accessible site. I focused on maintainability (variables, spacing scale), responsiveness, and small UX details (sticky nav, focus styles).
